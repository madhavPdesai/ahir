Some examples of AA code (shift-registers basically)

and the synthesis of the resulting logic compared
with a reference VHDL implementation
	ref/



Notes:
	1.  With SSA variables FF results are very close.
	2.  For incrementer, the VHDL version ends up being
		smaller because a longer carry chain is 
		inferred.  The ApIntAdd based operator 
		synthesizes to a larger number of LUTs...



Observations:
	1. As far as possible use SSA variables
		(note: using pipes has an overhead)
	2. Control-path overheads add up as 
		the complexity of the loop body increases
		(trivial operations to be moved to volatiles!)
	3. Deterministic operator is as efficient as hand-written.
