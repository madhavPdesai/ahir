fixed function libraries that can be dropped in
to the final VHDL.  Especially useful for 
instantiating highly optimized operators such
as floating-point operations etc.

basically, a hack to improve the quality of the
generated VHDL.


Each library (e.g. fpu) is specified by three
types of files.
	The C sources are in include/fpu.h and src/fpu.c

	The corresponding Aa source is in Aa/fpu.aa

	The list of functions in the library fpu is in ./fpu.list

The developer can link to the C sources to
test his/her C program, and to the Aa sources
to run the Aa2VC tool in the AHIR flow.  The
vc2vhdl tool in the AHIR flow will use the list
in ./fpu.list to substitute the correct VHDL instances 
into the final code.  The VHDL instances are in
the vhdl/ahir/functionLibrary subdirectory..

An example of the use of this flow is shown
in release/examples/correlator.
