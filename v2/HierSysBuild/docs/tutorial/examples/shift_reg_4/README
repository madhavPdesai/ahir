is described here.

The following files describe the shift register

Use
	./build.sh

to build the aa2c and vhdl models of the 
four stage shift-register.  

Use
	clean.sh
to clean up.

The ghdl script for compiling the generated VHDL is in
	ghdl/
   
The aa2c compiled library is in 
	lib/

The two stage shift register of which two copies
are used in the four stage shift register is here.
