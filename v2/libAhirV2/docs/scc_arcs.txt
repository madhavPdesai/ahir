	Adding arcs to influence strongly-connected component identification
	---------------------------------------------------------------------
		Madhav P. Desai

1. Overview

	Finding strongly connected components is the
	mechanism for identifying the places in the
	control path which are 1-safe.   This is
	done by a local analysis within a fork block's
	scope.   Consequently, some dependencies which
	are at a higher scope (e.g. caller of a module)
	are missed and the control path may needlessly need extra
	flip-flops and logic for implementation.

	
2. $scc_arc

	The control path can include the statement

	$scc_arc  tail_transition =>  head_transition

	to specify an external dependency between two
	internal transitions.   This will lead to larger
	strongly-connected components, hence leading to
	more places being marked as 1-safe.

	The $scc_arc statements are inserted by Aa2VC
	during the Aa->vC conversion.
