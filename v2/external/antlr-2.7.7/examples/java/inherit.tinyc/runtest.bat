rem Demonstrate how to subclass a grammar and actually get it to compile.
rem Biggest issue is making sure ANTLR, compiler, and interpreter can see
rem the supergrammar and classes needed by it.  In this case, the subgrammar
rem uses the supergrammar's lexer; it must be visible for the compiler and
rem interpreter.
rem
rem If you put a lexer here in this dir, you would not need all this
rem classpath crap.
